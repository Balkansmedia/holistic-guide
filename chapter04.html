      <p>Change within newsrooms, as primary exporters of culture and community engagement, has significant implications for general social awareness. When it comes to the women journalists actively pushing for more diverse representation and participation, they are (as they have almost always been, if we’re honest) powerful agents of change with the experience and knowledge to alter the current narratives impeding gender equity and media freedom. Just as information and awareness of risk can empower women online, so too can exposure to new ideas, identities and lived experiences, expand normative frameworks and increase the creation and sharing of knowledge within and between communities. What is gender-sensitive reporting, exactly, and how can it impact media and information literacy?.</p>

		<p>“When we look at women experts only as someone who is embedded in institution, we are actually recreating the patriarchal understanding of authority. A beautiful point was made here on the workshop, that we should add all our friends,women experts into a fan base. It doesn't need to be in the way that we understand women experts here in the Balkans,always attached to some sort of institutional, organizational hierarchies.This intersectional gender sensitive reporting is actually about rewiring, and that's why it is so difficult and that's why we often feel like stepping on someone else's territory. That's why women journalists have all this push back or misunderstandings even in an editorial level or at the level of society or even in the comment sections where your whole work and reputation is exposed. It's not only about having more women voices and more women perspective but it's also how we present and how we include them, how we portray them”</p>

	  <p><span class="emptextCH04">HOW TO:</span><strong> Addressing obstacles to well-being as opportunities for building resilience</strong></p>
			<ul class="two-column-list">
				<li><strong>Women as experts:</strong> Talk to women and members of underrepresented/marginalized communities as expert sources to increase their visibility and position them as primary narrators </li>
				<li><strong>Increase accessibility:</strong> when possible, provide translations of your work - ensuring that the community being covered can access the information being written about them. Alt text, using various forms of media, and colour/structure changes can also help ensure that multiple communities can effectively engage with a piece of content.</li>
				<li>When writing about a community you are not a member of, consult members of that community to ensure you are writing factually, and respectfully about them.</li>
				<li><strong>Reflect on your impact:</strong> gender awareness and sensitivity are a continual process. Looking back on past work, and analysing our engagement with marginalized communities and with experiences outside our own, can serve as an indicator for how we can improve in the future. </li>
				<li><strong>News as advocacy:</strong>increasingly journalists are compelled to use their platforms to build community, tackle injustice, and hold power to account. As a creator of news, and sharer of information, you have the right and responsibility to empower both your audience, and yourself through your reporting.</li>
				<li><strong>Weaponized objectivity:</strong>An important note - ‘objectivity’ has become a convenient tool to attempt to undermine personality, and empathy in news, and to make invisible marginalized narratives. Objectivity is weaponized when it forces you to undermine your humanity or lived experiences in pursuit of ‘factual’ or ‘unbiased’ reporting.</li>

	   <p><strong>The Gender and Media pilot project</strong> was carried out under the auspices of the <strong>Balkan Media Assistance Program to Foster Organizational Readiness While Advancing Resilient Development (BMAP Forward), funded by USAID and implemented by Internews as part of the PROGRESS Human Rights Support Mechanism.</strong> The pilot project was established to address the nuanced and complex obstacles to participation, representation, and safety that women journalists working in Balkans media face. To address these complex issues, we employed a holistic set of tools, participatory methodology and intersectional lens to investigate and rethink existing narratives about women’s experiences in media, and the perception of women’s role as journalists and media workers - locally, regionally, and from a broader global perspective.</p>
