	<div class="cls-1"><p>Women’s marginalization in the media is not going away, and in many places it is getting worse. ‘Solutions’ should acknowledge this reality, and that ultimate responsibility must be placed on perpetrators, including and especially Big Tech. We have seen over and over again the ‘business model’ approach of Big Tech undermines human rights, and since they refuse to deviate from this model, they cannot be considered good-faith partners, and we should focus on what can be changed without them” - Jennifer Adams, Pen to Paper, Project Team </p> </div>
