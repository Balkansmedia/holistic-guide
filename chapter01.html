      <h4 id="list-item-1">Changing the narrative to focus on physical, emotional and community well-being as a crucial prerequisite for and component of  holistic safety</h4>
      <p>The impact of OGBV/GD can extend beyond the targeted journalists to their families, friends, co-workers, or media outlets, with dissemination of harmful and prolific content that, over time, fosters and compounds feelings of insecurity, stress, and vulnerability. Given the proliferation of platforms and the necessary engagement with and in digital spaces, women journalists must regularly engage with those spaces and platforms of oppression where they face harm, but without the necessary tools and support to maintain their resilience and holistic well-being. Community well-being and resilience can be utilised as a powerful tool - both to combat gendered disinformation, and as a resource for targets of OGBV/GD - to build individual resilience and enable their continued engagement in the media ecosystem as a source of crucial information and media plurality.</p>

		<h4>Project participants overwhelmingly identified a decline in personal and community well-being as a crucial obstacle to their full agency in Balkans media. </h4>
		  <p >Participants shared a range of activities and practices that they use to build resilience, take needed space away from their work, and create their own communities of support, such as gardening, learning a new language, and a range of physical activities and somatic practices that build physical as well as emotional resilience.</p>
			
			<h4>Community conclusions: </h4>
		  <p><strong>Activities and practices that build resilience and contribute to well-being share a few key features:</strong></p>
		  <ul>
		  	<li>Skill- and capacity- building activities contribute to personal agency and self-esteem with spillover effects in other aspects of their daily life, including and especially their profession.</li>
			<li>Activities that nurture personal creativity create additional space for innovation at work.</li>
			<li>Safeguarding personal time and space results in higher-quality and more sustainable professional outputs. </li>

			<ul class="two-column-list">
				<li>When it comes to engagement with platforms of oppression, consider a risk/benefit analysis: What do you get out of a platform vs. what is the potential for/lived experience of harm? </li>
				<li>Prioritise physical well-being: proving to ourselves that we are worth time, attention and resources. This can manifest in so many practical ways: scheduling regular doctors visits, establishing and prioritising a sleep schedule, regular exercise and/or somatic practice to encourage health and process harmful emotions, properly feeding ourselves - even when we’re on a tight deadline or have other urgent tasks, taking time off when we feel unwell or need to prioritise care-giving responsibilities. Think about it: What is a self-care for you? How do you practice it?</li>
				<li>Take time and space away from work - physically (taking a walk, working from a different location, silencing work-related phone calls and meetings during private time) and emotionally (consuming content for pleasure or personal interest, establishing spaces and/ times when engagement with work is off-limits).</li>
				<li>Expand your experiences and indulge curiosity - Engage with content and activities that are new to you: podcasts, cultural events, and finding new forms for personal expression through activities like dance, art, or learning a new skill.</li>
				<li>Build and lean-on community: Spending quality time with friends and family - outside of care-giving responsibilities - can help recharge and restore our resilience. Get inspired and learn from others:<a href="https://bloom.chayn.co/"> Bloom - a healing journey course</a>. The mutual sharing of experiences, empathy and solutions with a supportive community can be a powerful outlet for negative emotions and stress. </li>

But you know, on my walk there I'm kind of thinking that it's good to have some fresh air and that I'm thankful for fresh air and that I'm able to go to the shop to buy things with my own money, money that I made while doing this job and that it's worth it...I try to be thankful for the small things that we need every day.

	   <p><strong>The Gender and Media pilot project</strong> was carried out under the auspices of the <strong>Balkan Media Assistance Program to Foster Organizational Readiness While Advancing Resilient Development (BMAP Forward), funded by USAID and implemented by Internews as part of the PROGRESS Human Rights Support Mechanism.</strong> The pilot project was established to address the nuanced and complex obstacles to participation, representation, and safety that women journalists working in Balkans media face. To address these complex issues, we employed a holistic set of tools, participatory methodology and intersectional lens to investigate and rethink existing narratives about women’s experiences in media, and the perception of women’s role as journalists and media workers - locally, regionally, and from a broader global perspective.</p>
