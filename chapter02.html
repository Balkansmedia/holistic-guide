      <h4 id="list-item-1">In friends and community, we trust: what is needed to leverage the power and support of your community? Changing the narrative that asking for help and leaning on community is a sign of vulnerability?</h4>
      <p>Research has found that journalists more often turn to peer support rather than therapy or reaching out to family and friends. This is true for both day-to-day stress, and dire situations that threaten their safety. Many women journalists in the Balkans make use of low-tech-Viber groups, slack, and in-person informal conversations to communicate and build community with each other. These channels have proven to be a source of both personal and community resilience, and a necessary outlet in a region where both the State and Big Tech fail to provide any meaningful support or security.  The expanding number of women in the media, and women’s role in leadership positions also seems to have played a role in growing the community of support journalists can offer and receive from one another. Not only are women organizing differently to improve their situation - in terms of newsroom environment and agency - but for women targeted with gendered manipulated information they have even more options for professional and personal solidarity through the sharing of experiences, normalizing collective processing of trauma, and providing a system of support for one another. </p>
	  <div class="quote-ch02">	
		<h4><strong>Example:</strong></h4> <p><strong ><a id="svijetlitekst" href="https://novinarkeprotivnasilja.org/en/">Journalists Against Violence</a></strong> in Serbia started as a small group of women working to improve the media’s reporting on cases of TFGBV. Today, the group serves as a platform for women journalists from outlets across the country to learn from and support other journalists targeted with violence, online and off. In a successful cross-border method of collaboration, they work together with organizations that specialize in countering TFGBV, including through provision of resources for mental and physical well-being to targeted journalists, and others working in the media.</p>  

<p>We identified and explored a trend we termed “solidarity zones” that has sprung up in response to the many obstacles marginalizing women’s holistic and meaningful media inclusion. Solidarity zones – spaces created by and for women for support, innovation and connection – appear in many ways and places. For some, they are private digital spaces like Viber or Slack chat groups, where women share their experiences with one another. These spaces often become resources unto themselves – a knowledge base for solutioning and documenting shared obstacles.</p>

		  <h2><span class="emptextCH02">HOW TO:</span></h2>
			<ul class="two-column-list">
				<li><strong>Turn to community:</strong> It really is as simple as going for a quick coffee with a colleague. Talk about your shared work, share tips and tricks for managing stress, asking for a raise, covering a shift or comparing notes for an upcoming interview. The small moments of communication are the building blocks for a sustainable framework of support. Take advantage of any mentorship or community meet-up opportunities when they arise.</li>
				<li><strong>Accessible and safe channels for communication:</strong> Digital tools and platforms - especially encrypted messaging systems - can serve as a useful communication channel to reach colleagues across the region, or coordinate discussion and advocacy initiatives around shared experiences and obstacles.</li>
				<li><strong>Bystander support:</strong> If you are targeted with violence or gendered manipulated information, ask someone to monitor your accounts to document the abuse for you. If someone you know is going through the experience, offer to document for them, or take time to check in, and offer your support in other ways.  Whatever kind of form of bystander support works best for you, please remember to inform your community that trust and confidentiality are a pre-condition to any meaningful conversation.</li>
				<li><strong>Dealing with instability and anxiety:</strong> The simple act of being heard and understood cannot be underestimated. Reaching out to others who may have gone through similar experiences, can be a meaningful step towards healing and resilience building. Therapy of all types can serve as a powerful space to develop tools for building resilience. For those in decision-making positions, ensuring your workplace has <a href="https://newsrooms-ontheline.ipi.media/">safety protocols and policies</a> in place (and enforced) goes a long way to creating a safety of culture for those working there.</li>
				<li><strong>Rest:</strong> In the aftermath of periods of extreme stress, allow yourself the time you need to rest, mentally and physically. Our brains simply cannot do our best work when we’re exhausted and depleted. Turn to your community, and ask them to help manage your responsibilities, and carry a bit of the mental load during this time. </li>

		<p>"One interviewee spoke to my colleague and insulted her in so many ways.
I called him later and he asked why am I calling him, when my colleague already did, at a time when he was drunk and she wanted him to tell her something, being very persistent. I asked him how he can speak in that manner with one women, a mother, being at the age where he could be her father, and is it okay that one man, a politician and somebody who is a director of a big company, talks in that manner with anybody especially with a woman journalist?! He put his guard down and then he gave me good quotes and I did my job."

		<p>“I always try to express my criticism, positive one, when it comes to women gender sensitivity especially vulnerable groups and the actual narrative. It is also rising the question is it changing or is it still like it was 25 years ago, do we have a transition here which is reflective which is always a big question mark. I don't want to criticize the journalism or the journalist who did it and how they did it, but it's also a matter of women showing up from different communities and it’s also our responsibility to push those women, to impact them, to motivate them positively so they rise their voices.“</p>

	   <p><strong>The Gender and Media pilot project</strong> was carried out under the auspices of the <strong>Balkan Media Assistance Program to Foster Organizational Readiness While Advancing Resilient Development (BMAP Forward), funded by USAID and implemented by Internews as part of the PROGRESS Human Rights Support Mechanism.</strong> The pilot project was established to address the nuanced and complex obstacles to participation, representation, and safety that women journalists working in Balkans media face. To address these complex issues, we employed a holistic set of tools, participatory methodology and intersectional lens to investigate and rethink existing narratives about women’s experiences in media, and the perception of women’s role as journalists and media workers - locally, regionally, and from a broader global perspective.</p>
