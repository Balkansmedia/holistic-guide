      <h4 id="list-item-1">Changing the narrative of a one-size-fits-all approach that adds additional risk to women in the media? Changing the narrative around digital hygiene as one of many resources than can help manage the impact of gendered disinformation, (and not a one-size fits all solution) </h4>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mfrr.eu/monitor/">Media Freedom Rapid Response</a> reporting mechanism has recorded numerous alerts to cases of women journalists targeted with incidents such as harassment, sexual harassment, threats and intimidation. Additionally, the BIRN and Share Foundation-run monitoring database on digital rights violations (BIRD) recorded several incidents highlighting the prevalence of OGBV and its impact on women journalists in the region. There is clearly enough data to identify the prevalence of harm facing women online and off, but not nearly enough knowledge on perpetrators, audience reactions to and engagement with harmful content, and the (lack of) meaningful response from tech companies. Digital hygiene and online security tools is an important, albeit one of many, resources for increasing women’s agency online. It is not, however, a tool for combatting gendered disinformation, or even for improving individual or community security, especially without equal - if not more - consideration and resource utilised to address perpetrators, and Big Tech business models that facilitate innovation when it comes to new and emerging methods of gendered violence and disinformation. Yes, women need as much information as possible when it comes to secure online access, protecting our accounts, our equipment and our information - including sensitive data and sources, especially for investigative journalists - but an equally important component of online security is ownership of digital public space, which Big Tech transparency (or lack thereof) currently - with little hope of future change - constitutes a major obstacle to. </p>

		<h4>EXAMPLE:</h4>
		  <p >The lack of state support in the Western Balkans, porous criminal legal protection, and absence of platform response - perpetuate the harms and oppression - developing personalized understanding of digital hygiene measures means deciding which tactics and tools work best for you. Women journalists in this project have real issues with stepping away from social media and exposing themselves to public – it is a part of their work – so Marija Pesic from Vijesti (Montenegro) makes regular breaks by doing daily grocery shopping instead of weekly once. 
</p>
		<p>KRIK has seen its share of lawsuits, smear campaigns and even threats of violence against its journalists. Yet, as an organization, it has been quite innovative, especially in the way it utilizes the digital ecosystem as part of a detailed strategy that enables its continued investigative work. KRIK has used negative tabloid/propaganda media coverage – attempts to smear KRIK investigations, undermine the integrity of its journalists, including through gendered disinformation, etc. – as a tool for visibility, and community engagement. From gendered disinformation to increase reach and visibility, KRIK is a case study that shows the power of digital literacy and security, when combined with digital empowerment through awareness of risk and potential strategies to minimize risk.</p>

			<ul class="two-column-list">
			  <li><strong>Digital security for empowerment:</strong> even just a basic understanding of risk and potential strategies to minimize risk is empowerment in the digital sphere.</li>
				<li><strong>A digital hygiene plan:</strong> a daily routine and <a href="https://securityplanner.consumerreports.org/">protection plan</a></li>
				<li><strong>Dox yourself!:</strong> <a href="https://cyber-women.com/en/">Self-doxxing</a> can be eye-opening, in terms of learning about the information publicly available about yourself, your family/friends and your work. You can dox yourself using reverse image searches, links to and from your newsroom, and searching other private information like your address, registration numbers (like passport, identity card, driver’s license, etc) and phone number.</li>
				<li><strong>Limit access to your person:</strong> make sure to turn off location trackers on your phone, and in each app that you use on your phone and other personal devices. Things like geo-tagging and other location services, can make it easier to track your physical location, as well as your general movement behaviour. </li>
				<li><strong>Subverting Big Tech:</strong> Ok, it can’t actually be done if you’re using their digital products - a HUGE problem in and of itself - but you can make choices that <a href="https://securityinabox.org/en/">help identify</a> and minimize risk online. </li>

		<p>“Encrypt your devices—USB drives, laptops, phones. Use complex, impenetrable passwords for all accounts and devices. Communicate via secure apps like Signal or encrypted emails. Discuss confidential matters with editors only in person, without phones, and outside the office. Assume the office is bugged; avoid discussing sensitive topics with colleagues. Physically secure the newsroom with armoured doors, alarms, and cameras. Keep devices in safes and never leave them unattended, especially in hotels. Install cameras at home, avoid discussing sensitive topics even there, and change your daily routes occasionally. Stay aware of your surroundings, trust your instincts, and limit personal information shared on social media. Report threats to authorities and seek public and colleague support.”</p>

But at the same time, you also have these people that continue to compliment and applaud you and at the same time, give you the understanding of this self-awareness and check in and check out objectives. It’s sort of hidden eye that you always must be aware of. (ends 12:55) </p>

	   <p><strong>The Gender and Media pilot project</strong> was carried out under the auspices of the <strong>Balkan Media Assistance Program to Foster Organizational Readiness While Advancing Resilient Development (BMAP Forward), funded by USAID and implemented by Internews as part of the PROGRESS Human Rights Support Mechanism.</strong> The pilot project was established to address the nuanced and complex obstacles to participation, representation, and safety that women journalists working in Balkans media face. To address these complex issues, we employed a holistic set of tools, participatory methodology and intersectional lens to investigate and rethink existing narratives about women’s experiences in media, and the perception of women’s role as journalists and media workers - locally, regionally, and from a broader global perspective.</p>
